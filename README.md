### Sudoku

## Description
The goal of sudoku is to complete a square grid of 9x9 cells using only numbers from 1 to 9, in a way that has exactly one instance of each digit appearing in each column. This project is a "sudoku assistant" designed to solve simple soduko puzzles. This project was a university assignment designed to test a the student's knowledge and understanding of arrays, strings, functions and typedef facility.


## How it works

# Reading and printing
Input to program should always be a 9x9 grid of with 0 used to represent empty cells. Input is provided in a text file. The program reads the input in row-major order using a sequence of 81 calls in a loop and stored as a one dimensional array. 

The output from the program will be a neatly-formatted representation of the input data plus a summary line. Below is an example of input(left) and output(right) of the program at this stage.
